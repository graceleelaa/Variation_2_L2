	<strong> <em> So We'll Go No More a Roving</em> </strong>
		<br><br><br>
		So, we’ll go no more a-roving<br>
  		So late into the night,<br>
		Though the heart be still as loving,<br>
		And the moon be still as bright.<br>
		For the sword outwears its sheath,<br>
		And the soul wears out the breast,<br>
		And the heart must pause to breathe,<br>
		And love itself have rest. <br>
		Though the night was made for loving,<br>
		And the day returns too soon,<br>
	    Yet we’ll go no more a-roving<br>
		By the light of the moon.<br> 	
	</p>
